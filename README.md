## Q Learning Base Movie Recommendation Project

This project uses q-learning (reinforcement learning) to create a movie recommendation sytem based on movies that a user has previously watched and enjoyed. The project uses movie ratings and tags from the movielens 25M dataset. The dataset contains 25 million reviews on over 62000 movies from 162000 different users.
